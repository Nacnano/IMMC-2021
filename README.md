# IMMC-2021
Codes for analysing and testing mathematical models for International Mathemathical Model Competition 2021

The problem for this year is Finding GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) player in any sport.
To be specific, we were given records (score, winer, loser, etc.) of every match of all Tennis Tournaments in the past centuries.
Our task is to create a mathematical model to find the best player from the given dataset.
